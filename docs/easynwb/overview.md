# EasyNWB
[nwb-widgets](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwbwidgets) provides a comprehensive GUI for visualizing the data in NWB filesâ€”but it does not provide a way to create or edit NWB files.

On the other hand, `easynwb` is designed to provide an optimal experience for **exploring and editing NWB file metadata** on the web.
