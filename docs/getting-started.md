# Getting Started with WebNWB
The [NWB:N] format is a powerful standard for storing and sharing neurophysiology data. Both users and developers typically interact with the NWB:N format through Python or MATLAB APIs, However, these can be difficult to use for non-programmers and are not well-suited for simple web applications‚Äîrequiring complicated distribution environments (e.g. [NWB Explorer], [NWB GUIDE]) for simple interactions. This limits the accessibility of NWB:N data and derivative tools.

`webnwb` is a JavaScript library designed to provide the optimal experience for **programmatically exploring and editing NWB file metadata** on the web. 
- üî¨ Read data from NWB files based on the included specification.
- ‚ö° Lazy-load large files (e.g. from the NIH Brain Initiative‚Äôs [Distributed Archives for Neurophysiology Data Integration (DANDI)](https://gui.dandiarchive.org/#/)).
- üì¶ Create NWB files from scratch.
- ‚öíÔ∏è Use helper functions like `addAcquisition`, `getAcquisition`, and `createAcquisition` to quickly write data to new and existing NWB files.

:::details A Brief History of WebNWB
The first version of WebNWB was prototyped during [NWB workshops and hackathons](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons/)in 2022 by [Garrett Flynn] from [Brains@Play](https://brainsatplay.com).

For most of 2023, WebNWB was generously supported by the [Kavli Foundation](https://kavlifoundation.org) to bring it from a proof-of-concept to a promising part of the NWB ecosystem. 

Ongoing development of WebNWB is occurring on an as-needed basis by [Garrett Flynn] adjacent to his work as a Neurodata Programmer at [Catalyst Neuro](https://catalystneuro.com).

### Related Tools
Several tools can be used with `webnwb` to provide a cohesive experience for web developers and users alike:
- [nwbwidgets] (Python) provides a comprehensive GUI for visualizing the data in NWB files.
- [neurosift] is an advanced browser-based visualizer for NWB files, integrated into the DANDI Archive.
- `easynwb` provides an intuitive interface for creating and editing NWB files.
- `dandi` provides an API for sharing NWB files.
- `nwb-inspector` provides a way to check the compliance of NWB Files with best practices, identical to the [Python version](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/nwbinspector).

## Does WebNWB Have An API Reference?
As much as possible, `webnwb` mirrors the [PyNWB] API. 

However, there are a few exceptions to note:
- Methods are implemented in camel case (e.g. `nwbfile.add_acquisition` becomes `nwbfile.addAcquisition`)

## The Road Ahead
The following sections provide a brief overview of the `webnwb` API in practice. 

If you would like to gain a comprehensive understanding of the capabilities of NWB tools, we recommend referring to the [PyNWB] documentation.
