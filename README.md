### Additional Tasks
- Differentiate Datasets and Groups
- Handle links, references, and tables with reference
- Implement write using [best practices](https://www.nwb.org/best-practices/) and the [schema](https://nwb-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format_description.html#nwbcontainer-nwbdata-nwbdatainterface-base-neurodata-types-for-containers-and-datasets)
- Demonstrate in the documentation with [tutorials](https://pynwb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/general/scratch.html#raw-data)


## Dependencies
**h5wasm:** https://github.com/usnistgov/h5wasm
> Note: [h5wasm](https://github.com/usnistgov/h5wasm) was difficult to bundle with Rollup, so it's required as an argument to the `webnwb.NWBHDF5IO` class.

**YAML Loaders:** [Rollup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rollup/plugin-yaml), [Webpack](https://github.com/eemeli/yaml-loader)
## Acknowledgments
**webnwb** was originally prototyped as part of the [2022 NWB-DANDI Remote Developer Hackathon](https://neurodatawithoutborders.github.io/nwb_hackathons/HCK12_2022_Remote/) by a large team of contributors, including;
- Garrett Flynn (gflynn@usc.edu)
- Chandhana Sathishkumar (chandhanasathishkumar@gmail.com)
- Emilio Bazan (Asim-v)
